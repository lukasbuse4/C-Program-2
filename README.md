# Program 2 - Cryptography

This project will give you practice using functions, loops, and operations with strings.

For full credit it must be completed no later than **6:00am CST, Monday February 22, 2021**. You may submit by **6:00am CST, Wednesday February 24, 2021** for a 30 point penalty. No programs will be accepted after that time so do not wait until the last minute to get started.

Writing programs usually take longer than you think so get started as soon as you can!
